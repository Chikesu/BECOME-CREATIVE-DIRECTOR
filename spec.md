# Crypto Video Hook & Launch Video Agent  
**(AI Video Pipeline for Whales Market)**

---

## 1. Overview

In crypto and DeFi, attention is scarce and information is complex. Product launches, feature updates, and partnership announcements often fail to capture attention in the first seconds.

This agent generates **high-impact video hooks and short launch/explainer videos** optimized for crypto audiences. It helps transform complex product updates into engaging visual content that can be used immediately across X (Twitter), Telegram, landing pages, and social channels.

Short 3–5 second openings also provide an immediate visual hook for content-heavy announcements, helping technical updates gain attention before deeper information is presented.
